		<p>I am currently a Sophomore at the University of Michigan. 
            I am pursing a major in Information Analysis at the <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a> and two minors through the colllege of Literature,
            Science, and Arts in Spanish and Entrepreneurship. My studies have provided me with a diverse and valuable skill set. Through my coursework in Information Analytics, I have developed a deep understanding of data analysis and the ability to derive insights from complex data sets. My Spanish studies have brought me closer to fluency in a second language and a deeper appreciation for different cultures. Finally, my Entrepreneurship studies have taught me how to think creatively, identify opportunities, and develop and launch new business ventures. These three areas of study have equipped me with the tools and knowledge needed to succeed in a variety of industries and pursue a wide range of career paths.</p>

		<p>
			Outside of school, I love to travel, spend time with my friends and family, spend time outside, and play tennis.</p>
